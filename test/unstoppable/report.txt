Notes:

  Token: DamnValuableToken (ERC20).

  Function <depositTokens>:

    Deposit tokens into the pool.
    Transfer from message sender to contract.
    Variable <poolBalance> will be updated. Track how much tokens the pool has.

  Function <flashLoan>:

    Request borrow amount (needs to be greater than 0).
    Calculates the balance of the pool using the value of function (implemented in ERC20).
    Requires <balanceBefore> is greater or equal than <borrowAmount>.
    Asserts that the <poolBalance> in <depositTokens> function is the same as <balanceBefore>.
    Transfers to the message sender the amount requested.
    Returns callback function on contract <IReceiver>.

Solution:

  Desynchronize <poolBalance> and <balanceBefore>. Change <poolBalance>. Transfer tokens outside the function <depositTokens>.
